## How to Use Your Bootable USB Drive for Windows 10
 
Now that you have created your bootable USB drive for Windows 10, you might be wondering how to use it. Here are some tips and tricks to help you get started:

- To use your bootable USB drive for Windows 10, you need to change the boot order of your computer. This means you need to tell your computer to boot from the USB drive instead of the hard drive or the DVD drive. To do this, you need to access the BIOS or UEFI settings of your computer. The exact steps may vary depending on your computer model and manufacturer, but usually you need to press a certain key (such as F2, F10, F12, or Esc) during the startup process to enter the BIOS or UEFI settings. Then, you need to find the boot order or boot priority option and move the USB drive to the top of the list. Save the changes and exit the BIOS or UEFI settings.
- Once you have changed the boot order of your computer, you can insert your bootable USB drive into any USB port and restart your computer. You should see a message asking you to press any key to boot from the USB drive. Press any key and wait for the Windows setup screen to appear.
- Follow the instructions on the screen to install or reinstall Windows 10 on your computer. You will need to choose your language, keyboard layout, time zone, and other preferences. You will also need to accept the license agreement and enter your product key if you have one. You can also customize your installation options, such as choosing which partition to install Windows on, formatting or deleting partitions, creating new partitions, and so on.
- After you have completed the installation or reinstallation process, you can remove your bootable USB drive from your computer and enjoy your fresh Windows 10 system.
